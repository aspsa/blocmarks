# Your secret key is used for verifying the integrity of signed cookies.
# If you change this key, all old signed cookies will become invalid!

# Make sure the secret is at least 30 characters and all random,
# no regular words or you'll be exposed to dictionary attacks.
# You can use `rake secret` to generate a secure secret key.

# Make sure the secrets in this file are kept private
# if you're sharing your code publicly.

  # If you're using Rails 4.1 or newer, your secret keys will be in config/secrets.yml, and set differently based on the environment. In this case, we suggest generating a random token and setting it as ENV['SECRET_KEY_BASE'] on Heroku. To do this, run rake secret from the command line to generate a token, and heroku config:set SECRET_KEY_BASE=thegeneratedtoken to set that token to that ENV variable on production.
  #
  # This makes your Development and Production tokens distinct, as opposed to the case below. For simplicity, add SECRET_KEY_BASE to your application.yml instead, and use Figaro to sync the tokens on Production and Development. Then set the Development key to equal the same ENV-stored token as the Production key in secrets.yml.
